                    <br>
                    <p class="lead">Edinburgh began as a fort. Castle Rock is an easily defended position so from the
                        earliest times it was the site of a fort. In the 7th century,
                        the English captured this part of Scotland and they called this place Eiden’s burgh (burgh is an
                        old word for fort). In the 10th century, the Scots re-captured the area.
                        Late in the 11th century, King Malcolm III built a castle on Castle Rock and a small town grew
                        up nearby. By the early 12th century Edinburgh was a flourishing community.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="h4 font-weight-bold">IN THE 16TH & 17TH CENTURY</h4>
                    <p class="lead">By 1500 Edinburgh probably had a population of 12,000. It rose to about 15,000 by
                        1550. It seems very small but towns were tiny in those days.
                        By the standards of the time, Edinburgh was a large town. In the late 16th century an English
                        writer described Edinburgh: ‘From the King’s Palace in the east the city rises
                        higher and higher to the west and consists mainly of one broad and very fair street. The rest of
                        the side streets and alleys are poorly built and inhabited by very poor people.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4 class="h4 font-weight-bold">IN THE 18TH & 19TH CENTURY</h4>
                    <p class="lead">During the early 18th century Edinburgh continued to grow. By mid-century,
                        it was severely overcrowded. The Lord Provost decided to build a new town on the land north of
                        Edinburgh. In 1767 a competition was held to decide the best plan. The winner was a young
                        architect
                        called James Craig. Accordingly, new broad streets, circuses, and crescents were erected at the
                        New Town.
                        Although 18th century Edinburgh was not a manufacturing center there was an important
                        shipbuilding industry
                        at Leith the city’s port.
                        <br><br>
                        In the 19th century, Edinburgh did not become a manufacturing center and so lost its position as
                        Scotland’s number
                        one city to Glasgow. The only significant industries in Edinburgh were printing and brewing.
                        Edinburgh remained a
                        city of lawyers and bankers. Despite its failure to become an industrial centre, Edinburgh grew
                        rapidly during the 19th century.
                        The population was under 100,000 in 1801 but it had grown to 170,000 by 1851.

                    <h4 class="h4 font-weight-bold">20TH CENTURY - TODAY</h4>
                    <p class="lead">In the 20th century, Edinburgh remained a city of banking, insurance, and other
                        service industries. Meanwhile,
                        Edinburgh’s famous floral clock was made in 1903. Edinburgh zoo opened in 1913. Usher Hall
                        opened in
                        1914. The Scottish National War Memorial was built in 1927. Meanwhile, amenities in Edinburgh
                        continued to improve.
                        During the 20th century, the old industries of insurance, banking, printing, and brewing in
                        Edinburgh continued to prosper.
                        Then in the late 20th century tourism became an increasingly important industry. The Museum of
                        Childhood opened in 1955.
                        In 1999, a Scottish parliament opened in Edinburgh after a gap of 292 years.
