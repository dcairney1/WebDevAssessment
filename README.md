**CS1031 Assessment 3 – Report**

**Design philosophy:**

Consistency was the big thing I tried to focus heavily on, I wanted the design to be consistent page to page. It shouldn’t feel like the user has visited a completely different site by simply clicking on another page. This meant maintaining consistent typefaces, colours and UX elements across all of the webpages.


Responsiveness through the use of bootstrap was also extremely important as responsiveness is more important than ever due to the ever-increasing number of users browsing the web from phones and other devices. In fact, almost 50% of all webpage views now come from mobile devices.

**Problems encountered:**

The main problem I had was with the header image/banner that is shown on all of the webpages, I couldn’t get it to display quite how I wanted it to, but after some trial and error and the help of online documentation I was able to make it display as intended. Besides this I encountered no major difficulties, and it was mostly a matter of taking the time to think through stylistic choices when designing the website. 

Validator errors were another issue, I located validator errors using the W3C Markup validator service. I fixed each validator error with some trial and error. However, I will note that validator errors still exist with all buttons located on the visit.html webpage and while I could fix these errors after Googling around and investigating the issue my current solution seems to be generally accepted practice, despite the validator spitting out errors (see below for some discussion on the issue). Everything else validates perfectly.
