**CS1031 Assessment 3 – Report**

**Design philosophy:**

Consistency was the big thing I tried to focus heavily on, I wanted the design to be consistent page to page. It shouldn’t feel like the user has visited a completely different site by simply clicking on another page. This meant maintaining consistent typefaces, colours and UX elements across all of the webpages.


Responsiveness through the use of bootstrap was also extremely important as responsiveness is more important than ever due to the ever-increasing number of users browsing the web from phones and other devices. In fact, almost 50% of all webpage views now come from mobile devices.

**Problems encountered:**

The main problem I had was with the header image/banner that is shown on all of the webpages, I couldn’t get it to display quite how I wanted it to, but after some trial and error and the help of online documentation I was able to make it display as intended. Besides this I encountered no major difficulties, and it was mostly a matter of taking the time to think through stylistic choices when designing the website.
